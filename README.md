# 2048-game-python
This is my first game that i coded for a college project in Python. It is a copy of the famous game 2048.The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is over when no more moves are possible.
How to Play:
    i) Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles.
    ii)When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with the sum of their values.
    iii)The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.
    iv)The game ends when there are no more valid moves.
